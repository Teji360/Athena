OCHA added new Census 2014 districts by digitizing the general areas from map images in the Angola INE census pdf report that were geo-referenced . The edited boundaries therefore do not have a high spatial accuracy, however may still be beneficial for planning and population purposes. 

Edits were made to the Commune (Admin 3) data and dissolved to Administrative Boundary 2/1/0 levels to ensure nesting, and topology checked.

The following boundary changes were made based on the INE Census 2014 data and maps: 

•	Added new Catumbela Municipality in Benguela Province

•	Added new Cacula Municipality in Huila Province

•	Merged municipalities into new Luanda Municipality (there are fewer municipalities in the new data set as Ingombota, Kilamba Kiaxi Maianga, Rangel and Sambizanga have been merged to create the new Luanda municipality, as per Census 2014 data and maps).

•	Adjusted boundaries of Cazenga, Viana and Belas/Samba, Cacuaco, Cazenga and Dande municipalities as per Census 2014 data and maps.

•	Adjusted Province boundaries, based on Census 2014 data and maps (boundary changes for Luanda, Lunda Norte, Lunda Sul, Beng ,Cuanza Norte,  and Malanje Provinces )

•	Changed Province for Icolo e Bengo municipality from Bengo to Luanda, as per Census 2014 reports from INE.

•	Changed Province for Bula Aumba, Dembos and Pangol Alquem municipalities from Cuanze Norte to Bengo, as per Census 2014 reports from INE.

The MoES published these administrative boundaries online and made publicly available.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) for Caucasus and Central Asia with support from OCHA FIS cleaned the administrative level 3 dataset, integrated P-codes according to the State Classification of Administrative and Territorial Units (COATE) of the Kyrgyz Republic, 2018, names in 3 languages (English, Kyrgyz, Russian) and place types.  Twelve independent cities (from the same source but a different dataset) were added to the administrative level 3 dataset to ensure it fully corresponds to the COATE. 

ITOS live services will be added at a later date.

The Kyrgyz administrative boundary system does not designate administrative level 3 (community) features outside administrative level urban areas although those areas are characterized by rural type.  This administrative level 3 shapefile and KMZ file includes ‘expanded’ units with special P-code suffixes which characterize the features according to an OCHA developed coding system.  For instance, the Forestry in Uzgen district (KG06255000000) has a Pcode of KG06255000901. 

Some source polygons were indicated as ‘Unknown’ and are designated as such in the gazetteer.

The gazetteer contains the standard administrative level 3 table and an 'expanded' administrative level 3 table.

The ‘expanded’ administrative level 3 P-code suffix system is described below:
ADM3_PCODE suffix	ADM3Type_EN	ADM3Type_RU	ADM3Type_KY

The list is then sent to Ward focal points and traditional leaders from respective LGAs to verify which Wards the settlements belong. This confirmation forms the basis for demarcating the ward boundaries. The ehealth boundaries are operational and constantly being updated. 

The Ehealth boundaries are also cross-checked with the list of wards available from the Independent National Electoral Commission to harmonise the two available sources of ward level information.
