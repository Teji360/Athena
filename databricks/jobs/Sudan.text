1. Ukraine: Entering the Fifth Year of War
As the fourth anniversary of the 2022 invasion passes (February 24, 2026), the conflict remains a high-intensity war of attrition with a devastating human toll.

Frontline Status: Ukrainian forces have recently conducted successful counter-operations in Southern Ukraine, reportedly liberating approximately 300 square kilometers around the Dnipropetrovsk-Zaporizhia border. However, Russia continues a heavy offensive in the Hulyaipole direction.

Infrastructure Crisis: Ukraine is enduring one of the coldest winters on record (with temperatures hitting -20°C). Targeted Russian strikes have damaged 70% of the nation's energy facilities, leaving millions in Kyiv and other cities without consistent heat or water.

Casualties & Displacement: 2025 was recorded as the deadliest year for civilians since the start of the war. Currently, there are roughly 6.9 million Ukrainian refugees registered globally.

International Support: A "deadly triple crisis" has emerged as international donor funding has seen dramatic cuts, threatening the survival of nearly one-third of women-led humanitarian organizations in the country.

2. Sudan: The World’s Worst Humanitarian Crisis
The war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has effectively divided the country.

Battle for Control: Following the RSF’s capture of El-Fasher (the last SAF stronghold in Darfur) in late 2025, the SAF has retaliated by retaking Dilling and Kadugli in South Kordofan.

The Toll: Over 150,000 people have been killed since April 2023, and 14 million are now displaced. The U.S. and EU recently sanctioned three RSF commanders for "horrific campaigns of ethnic killings" and starvation tactics during the 18-month siege of El-Fasher.

Proxy Dynamics: Observers warn of an "intense proxy competition" with Saudi Arabia allegedly backing the SAF and the UAE supporting the RSF, further complicating peace efforts.

3. Gaza & Israel: Transition and Transition Committees
The conflict has moved into a "Stage Two" framework following a 20-point UN-endorsed plan from October 2025.

Governance: A Board of Peace (chaired by the U.S.) and a Palestinian National Committee have been established to oversee the administration and reconstruction of Gaza. Hamas has signaled a willingness to cede governance but remains critical of "international guardianship."

Casualties: New peer-reviewed studies and UN reports indicate the actual death toll is much higher than initial estimates. The UN reports that over 68,800 Palestinians have been killed since October 2023, with verified data confirming at least 463 deaths by starvation in recent months.

Hostage Status: The body of the final hostage taken on October 7, 2023, was reportedly recovered in late January 2026.

4. Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC): The Rise of M23
The eastern DRC has seen a dramatic escalation in violence as the M23 rebel group (Alliance Fleuve Congo) continues its expansion.

Territorial Losses: In early 2025, M23 seized Goma and Bukavu, the capitals of North and South Kivu provinces, respectively. They have since established parallel administrations in these regions.

Diplomatic Efforts: On February 3, 2026, the DRC government and M23 signed a ceasefire monitoring mechanism in Doha, though the UN warns the security situation remains "volatile and deteriorating."

Regional Tensions: The DRC continues to accuse Rwanda of supporting the rebels, leading to the Washington Agreements signed in December 2025 to de-escalate regional hostilities.

5. Myanmar: Five Years After the Coup
The military junta is struggling to maintain its grip as a coalition of ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) and the People’s Defense Force (PDF) makes gains.

Territorial Decline: Investigations show the junta now controls only about 21% of the country, while rebel forces hold 42%.

Elections: Controlled elections were held in late January 2026 to provide a "veneer of legitimacy," but they have been widely dismissed by the international community.

Demographics of Conflict: Total fatalities since the 2021 coup have surpassed 89,200. Nearly 4 million people are internally displaced.
