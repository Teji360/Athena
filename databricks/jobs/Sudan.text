In February 2026, the long-standing ethnic and political tensions between the Dinka and Nuer groups in South Sudan have escalated into a renewed and fragmented civil conflict, effectively ending the fragile 2018 Revitalized Peace Agreement (R-ARCSS).

Current Political and Security Crisis (Early 2026)
The security situation reached a breaking point in late 2025 and early 2026. Following the March 2025 house arrest of First Vice President Riek Machar (Nuer), the government formally charged him with treason and murder in September 2025, alleging he orchestrated a "White Army" militia attack on Nasir. As of February 2026, Machar remains in detention while his trial continues in Juba, a move widely condemned by opposition forces as a political maneuver to sideline him ahead of the elections now postponed to December 2026.

In response, the Sudan People’s Liberation Army-in-Opposition (SPLA-IO) and allied Nuer militias launched a major offensive in January 2026. They have made rapid gains in Jonglei and Upper Nile states—traditional Nuer strongholds—capturing towns like Waat and Yuai. By mid-February, these forces were reported to be advancing toward Bor, a strategic Dinka stronghold, raising fears of large-scale ethnic retaliations reminiscent of the 2013 civil war.

Ethnic and Regional Dynamics
While the conflict is often framed as a binary struggle between President Salva Kiir’s Dinka-led government and Machar’s Nuer base, current events show increasing fragmentation within both groups. Power struggles among Dinka sub-clans and Nuer elites have emerged as resources dwindle. Furthermore, the war in neighboring Sudan has spilled over; reports indicate that the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) are supplying weapons to Nuer militias in Upper Nile to counter South Sudan's alleged support for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

Humanitarian Context
Data from the Sudan Mass Information records and recent UN flash updates paint a dire picture of the human cost:

Mass Displacement: In Jonglei state alone, over 280,000 people were displaced by mid-February 2026 due to aerial bombardments and ground fighting.

Health and Infrastructure: In Nyirol County, 13 of 16 health facilities have been destroyed, and Ayod County has seen widespread looting of medical supplies. This is devastating for a country where maternal mortality is already among the highest in the world at 1,223 per 100,000 live births.

Food Insecurity: The WFP is currently targeting nearly 500,000 people on the brink of catastrophic hunger in the Greater Upper Nile region.

Demographics: The Dinka remain the largest ethnic group, followed by the Nuer, within a total national population estimated at 13.1 million. Life expectancy remains low at 57.9 years, and the under-five mortality rate of 97.4 per 1,000 is expected to rise as cholera outbreaks and displacement camps become overwhelmed.

As of February 20, 2026, international observers and the UN Security Council have warned that South Sudan is on the "brink of collapse," with the military-led government in Juba increasingly isolated as it faces a multi-front rebellion and a total breakdown of the post-war order.
